# Ansible-repo

This is the repo where I'll learn Ansible.

## Few of the git command that we will use during our upcoming journey.

1)  git clone repolist         --> Download the whole repository
2)  git pull                   --> Download only the chnages.
3)  git add filename           --> Git will start tracking the chnages you're naking on the file named filename.
4)  git commit -m "msg name"   --> Adding commait msg to the commit / changes you made.
5)  git push                   -->  Your changes will be pushed to the repo. 

## PS: Ensure you are inside the repo to execute the git command ; We'll perform clone once and pull multiple time.
